# Inbound Webhook DataSources in Designer

In this article, we'll create an Inbound Webhook DataSource in Designer, send data to it from your own app or automation, and show that data on your screens.

Most DataSources in Designer go out and fetch your data on a schedule. An **Inbound Webhook** works the other way round. Your own system sends data to a private URL the moment something happens, and your screens show it within seconds. You don't need a spreadsheet, a polling interval or a manual refresh.

This is the preferred option for people who want an immediate update. Simply set up a webhook that fires on your end, then any changes to your Data will refresh within OptiSigns and on your screens rapidly.

## What You'll Need

- An OptiSigns **Pro Plus** or **Enterprise** plan. Inbound Webhooks are part of [Dynamic Data Mapping](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187-How-to-Set-Up-Dynamic-Data-Mapping-with-OptiSync).
- A design open in [Designer](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/42087942047379).
- A system that can send an HTTP POST or PUT API request with a JSON body

## How It Works

When you create an Inbound Webhook DataSource, Designer gives you a private **Webhook URL**. Anything that can send an HTTP POST request can use it: Zapier, Make, Shopify, a point-of-sale system, or a script you write yourself. Each request carries JSON, and that JSON becomes rows in the DataSource. You show those rows on screen with a Repeater, the same way you would with any other DataSource.

Each Inbound Webhook DataSource runs in one of two display modes. You choose the mode when you create the DataSource.

- **State** - Replace the whole value each time. Every request overwrites what was there before, and nothing expires on its own. Use it for things that have one current value, such as a KPI, a total, a menu, a roster or a scoreboard.
- **Event** - Append each row. Every request adds to the feed, and every row expires automatically after a set time. Use it for things that happen, such as new orders, alerts, check-ins or a "now serving" number.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Display mode is fixed once the DataSource exists. To use the other mode, create a new DataSource.

## Creating an Inbound Webhook DataSource

### Open the DataSource Panel

In Designer, click **DataSource** in the left-side menu to open the **DataSources** panel, then click **Add DataSource**.

### Choose Inbound Webhook

Under **Nested, JSON format**, choose the **Inbound Webhook** card ("Push data in from any app or automation that can POST").

![Add DataSource picker with the Inbound Webhook card under Nested, JSON format highlighted](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55747033217427)

### Name the DataSource and Pick a Display Mode

Enter a **DataSource Name**.

Under "Display Mode", choose **State** or **Event**.

If you chose **Event**, set how the feed behaves:

Then, click **Generate Webhook**.

### Copy your Webhook URL

Designer creates the DataSource and shows the **Webhook URL (key included)** and the **Key**. Copy it with the copy icon and paste it into the system that will send the data. The URL will look like this:

```
https://smallapp.optisigns.com/api/request-apis/dataSourceDatas/<DataSource ID>/webhook?key=<your key>
```

![Generated Webhook URL and Key, blurred, with the URL copy icon highlighted](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55719362187283)

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> Treat this URL like a password. Anyone who has it can send data to this DataSource. If it leaks, click the regenerate icon next to the **Key** and confirm **Regenerate**. The old link stops working immediately, and your column mapping and existing rows are kept.

![Regenerate key confirmation dialog warning that the current link stops working, with the Regenerate button](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55747023353875)

### Detect your Payload (optional)

Designer needs to know which fields your data contains before you can place them on the canvas. Under **Detect Payload (Optional)**, do one of these:

- **Listen for a delivery** - Click it, then send one real request from your system. Designer reads the fields from what arrives.
- **Paste sample JSON** - Click it, paste an example of your payload into the box, then click **Detect columns**.

Designer lists what it found under **Detected fields (example values)**. You can run either option again later (**Listen again to add fields** or **Re-detect columns**) to pick up new fields. New fields are added to the ones Designer has already seen, so your existing mapping stays in place.

![Detect Payload with sample JSON pasted and the detected fields order, customer and status listed](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55719345210899)

Click **Save** to finish.

### Put the Data on your Design

Drag a field from the DataSource card onto the canvas. Designer asks whether to use the data in a Repeater or on its own. Choose **Use in a Repeater** so the design creates one item per row. **Use on its own** places a single value instead.

![Dialog asking whether to use the dragged field in a Repeater or on its own, with Use in a Repeater highlighted](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55747002517139)

Save the design and push it to your screens. For more on laying out repeated data, see [How to Set Up Dynamic Data Mapping with OptiSync](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/29217646663187).

## Send Data to Your Webhook

Send JSON to your Webhook URL with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. A screen picks up a change within about 20 seconds.

### What POST and PUT Do

What each request does depends on the display mode:

- **Event mode**
  - **POST** - Adds one row. Send a list (a JSON array) to add several rows at once.
  - **PUT** - Replaces every row with the rows you send.
  - PUT with an empty body - Removes every row. Send {}, [] or {"data": []}.
- **State mode**
  - **POST** or **PUT** - Either one replaces the current values. Any field you leave out is cleared.

For example, this request adds one order to an Event feed:

```
curl -X POST "https://smallapp.optisigns.com/api/request-apis/dataSourceDatas/<DataSource ID>/webhook?key=<your key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order": "1042", "customer": "Sam", "status": "Ready"}'
```

To add several rows in one request, send a JSON array:

```
[
  {"order": "1042", "status": "Ready"},
  {"order": "1043", "status": "Preparing"}
]
```

To replace every row with `PUT`, you can send an array like the one above, or wrap it as `{"data": [ ... ]}`.

> **NOTE**With `POST`, a body shaped `{"data": [ ... ]}` is treated as one row with a field called `data`. To send several rows with `POST`, send a plain array.

### Set an expiry on individual rows

In Event mode, each row expires after the DataSource's **Default expire after** time. To give one row its own lifetime, add `__opti_ttl` with a number of seconds:

```
{"alert": "Lane 3 closed", "__opti_ttl": 300}
```

This row expires after 5 minutes, whatever the default is. The shortest expiry is 60 seconds. `__opti_ttl` is used to work out the expiry and isn't stored as a column.

Expired rows stop showing on your screens. In Designer they stay on the DataSource card, marked **(expired)**. To check which rows are live, open the DataSource's **⋮** menu and choose **Edit Data**. The **Status** column shows **Live** or **Expired** for each row. This view is read-only, because the data comes from your sender.

![Edit Data grid for a webhook DataSource with a Status column showing one Expired row and one Live row](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/article_attachments/55747013126419) When a feed has no live rows left, your screens follow the DataSource's **Empty Data Handling** setting.

> **TIP**
>
> Avoid naming your own fields with the `__opti_` prefix. That prefix is reserved for OptiSigns, so fields that use it are not shown in Designer.

### Send the key in a header

The URL Designer gives you carries the key in the query string (`?key=...`). If your sender lets you set custom headers, you can remove `?key=...` from the URL and send the key in an `X-Webhook-Key` header instead. Web servers and tools often log full URLs, so keeping the key out of the URL means it won't end up in those logs.

```
curl -X POST "https://smallapp.optisigns.com/api/request-apis/dataSourceDatas/<DataSource ID>/webhook" \
  -H "X-Webhook-Key: <your key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order": "1042", "status": "Ready"}'
```

### Limits

Your webhook checks every request against these limits. They aren't shown in Designer.

- **Rows** - A feed holds up to 200 rows, or fewer if you set a lower **Keep at most**.
- **Request size in Event mode**
  - **One row** - Up to 64 KB per request.
  - **A list of rows, or any PUT** - Up to 256 KB per request, with each row still up to 64 KB.
- **Request size in State mode** - Up to 256 KB per request.
- **Rate** - Up to 120 requests per minute for each webhook.

For scale, a typical e-commerce order notification is 10 to 40 KB, so one order fits comfortably in a single row.

A request over a limit is rejected as a whole, and nothing from it is saved. Rows are never cut off partway.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> A payload that passes **Detect columns** or **Listen for a delivery** can still be too large to deliver. Check your real payload size against the limits above, especially for large records such as full e-commerce orders.

## Change or Reopen a Webhook

To see your Webhook URL again, change the name, or change Event settings, open the **DataSources** panel and click your DataSource to open its card. Click the **⋮** menu on the card and choose **Edit Settings**.

## Troubleshooting

In this section, we'll address some of the more common issues you might run into when using Inbound Webhooks in Designer.

#### My system got a success response, but nothing changed in Designer.

Designer doesn't refresh its view of a DataSource on its own. Open the DataSource's **⋮** menu and choose **Refresh data (in Design Mode only)**, or reload the page. Your screens update on their own.

#### The DataSource says "This feed is empty. Send a POST to this webhook URL to fill it."

Nothing has arrived yet, or the feed was cleared by a `PUT` with an empty body. Check that your sender is using the current Webhook URL.

#### Rows are listed in Designer but don't show on the screen.

The rows have expired. Check **Default expire after** and any `__opti_ttl` values you send. If a value like a menu or a KPI keeps disappearing, it was probably built in Event mode, where every row expires by design. Create a new DataSource in **State** mode for it.

#### I see duplicate rows.

When a sender retries a request, each retry adds a row. To prevent duplicates, send a unique `X-Request-Id` header with each request. Shopify webhooks are recognized automatically by their `X-Shopify-Webhook-Id` header.

#### My sender gets an error.
